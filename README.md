StudentDB
=========

Mum needed a new database for kids at her school, so I spent the weekend (and some) building a site with AngularJS and Parse.com

I've included an simple [ExpressJS][7] app that you can use to host the site locally.

Signup to Parse.com and create a new application, from there you can copy the applicationId and javascriptSdkId key if you want to play around with the Parse backend! You need to follow the documentation from Parse to learn how to lock the application down. 

- https://parse.com/docs/data#security
- https://parse.com/docs/js_guide#users-security
- https://parse.com/docs/js_guide#users-acls

Libraries used:
- [AngularJS][0] Superheroic JavaScript MVW FrameworkJavascript MVC by Google.
- [AngularStrap][1] Bootstrap directives for AngularJS.
- [Bootstrap][2] Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
- [Parse.com][3] Mobile cloud platform. Parse lets you focus on creating unique & engaging apps.
- [Moment.js][4] A 5.5kb javascript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- [Toastr][5] Simple javascript toast notifications
- [jQuery][6] jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

This is my first AngularJS site so if you have any tips let me know on twitter [@jakescott][6]

Demo hosted on dropbox, sign up and have a play around!
