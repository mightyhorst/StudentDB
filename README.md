StudentDB
=========

Mum needed a new database for kids at her school, so I spent the weekend (and some) building a site with AngularJS and Parse.com

Libraries used:
- [AngularJS][0] Superheroic JavaScript MVW FrameworkJavascript MVC by Google.
- [AngularStrap][1] Bootstrap directives for AngularJS.
- [Bootstrap][2] Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
- [Parse.com][3] Mobile cloud platform. Parse lets you focus on creating unique & engaging apps.
- [Moment.js][4] A 5.5kb javascript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- [Toastr][5] Simple javascript toast notifications
- [jQuery][6] jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

This is my first AngularJS site so if you have any tips let me know on twitter [@jakescott][6]

Demo hosted on dropbox, sign up and have a play around!
